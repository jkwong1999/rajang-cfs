# Testing Plan for Rajang Customer Frontend System

Testing will be conducted by getting friends who are doing part-time job. They 
can also assume the role of blue-collar employer if they want to :)

## Brief Test Plan

### UI
User will rate the UI based on each section/features mentioned below through Google Form.
This means that this is a very independent testing process. The user is on his own. :)

In addition, we will not be providing screenshots for the testers so that we can 
test how intuitive our design is, plus, we are also lazy :) 

This means that this testing plan is purely user-oriented instead of 
programmer-oriented :)

### Main Features
This part is user related only ie how the webpages should behave when the user 
is having fun with the system :)

#### Home Page
A welcome page with a brief history of Rajang and the related system.
Here the user will have to find the "Sign up" or "Log in" link form the menu to 
start using the system.

#### Registration / Login
- Registration Page
Here user will have to fill in the form. All details must be filled and 
vaildation must pass before an acount is created for the user.

- Login Page
User will key in their resgistration account and password to be authorized to 
use the system.

#### Dashboard
After logging in successfully, a message will be shown and the user will be 
directed to the dashboard page. Depending on the status if subscription, the user
might or might not see statistics related his/her account.

The user must subscribe to a subscription before the system is really ready to 
use.

- Pre-Subscription Dashboard
The user will only see the menu bar on the left and on the top. The rest of the 
space will be a white blank space.

- Post-Subscription Dashboard
The user will see graphs related to the current account eg. total CV's submitted 
over a period of a week.

#### Subscribtion Page
A few subscriptions will be available to the user. The user has to choose only
one subscription in order to use the system.

This is a paid feature. See next section on "Payment Page" for more details.

#### Payment Page
This is the place where the user link their card to the system. This step is only
required once. All subsequent payment will be charged to the card number the user
enter in this section.

#### Hiring Campaign
Users can add job vacancies post tgether with the ability to publish, edit, 
unpublish and delete posts.

Job vacancies details will include current location of residence, age, working 
experience, job expertise, DISC & RIASEC personality

This is a paid feature :)

#### Manage Job Vacancies/Posts


#### CV Listing / Shortlist
The user should see a list of CV available in the database. This feature allows
the user to view partial CV details and reserve it. After purchasing the CVs, 
the user can view the full CV details.

The partial CV details only contains the fields that the employer is required to 
fill in when they make a job post. These partial details include age, working 
experience, highest education level, DISC & RIASEC personality and job expertise.

Reserving the CV will cause the corresponding CV to be adder to the cart.

#### Cart Feature
The cart will include all the CV reservations that the user chose to reserve in 
the CV listing page. Here the user can click a "Checkout" button and the system 
will bring the user to the checkout page for confirmatin of payment.

The cart is only a feature and not a page by itself. This feature can be found 
in the top menu bar.

#### Checkout Page
This is the page where user confirm their purchase of CVs. This page will list 
out the details of the purchase such as total cost, order type ie transaction 
name, and the datetime of the transaction as well as the status of the transaction.

#### Wallet
This is the plce where the user can top up tokens that is necessary to pay for 
the features available in the system.

Here user can also view his/her transaction history.

### Logic of Codes
Anything related to DB will go here, maybe skip this part? :)
#### Dashboard
#### Subscribtion Page
#### Payment Page?
#### Hiring Campaign
#### Manage Job Vacancies/Posts
#### CV Listing / Shortlist
#### Wallet

### ISO Standards
